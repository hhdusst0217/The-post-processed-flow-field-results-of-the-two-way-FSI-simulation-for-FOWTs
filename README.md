This branch presents the 3D flow field visualization results for floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) and bottom fixed wind turbine (BFWT). It can be observed that the platform motion results in a more compact vortex ring structure in the FOWT. Additionally, the FOWT exhibits a faster vortex wake dissipation compared to the BFWT.
